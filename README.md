## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` & _Google Fonts CDN_ with `index.html`
- Then, imported _CSS Color Variables_ and _base font size_ which were provided in the `style-guide.md` file.
- After this, I initailized the `css` file and set the minimum height and width, background color, font-family and font-color for the `body` element.
- Then, I wrote the necessary `html` code to develop the _UI Design Sample_ and also added necessary css stylings to match as close as possible withe the _UI Design Sample_.
- Finally, added necessary stylings for the active-states.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a simple basic project with HTML and CSS. As I've done similar projects earlier, by doing this project, I just revised my previous learnings.

### Useful resources

- [100 CSS Box Shadow Examples](https://htmlcssfreebies.com/css-box-shadow-examples/) - This helped me to add box shadow.
